## Configuration

### Setting Up the Secret Key

This project uses a secret key for cryptographic signing. You must configure this key for the application to run properly. Hereâ€™s how to set it up:

1. **Generate a Secret Key**: You can generate a new secret key using the following command:
   ```bash
   python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"
   
2. **Create a .env File**: In the project root directory (where manage.py is located), create a file named ``.env``

3. **Add the Secret Key to the .env File**: Open the .env file and add the following line, replacing your-generated-secret-key with the key you generated:
```plaintext
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY='your-generated-secret-key'
```
4. **Add the .env File to .gitignore**: Ensure that the ``.env`` file is included in your ``.gitignore`` to prevent it from being pushed to GitHub, which could expose your secret key.
