Step 1:     model-done  -test-NA
Step 2:     usercreate  -test OK
            login       -test OK
            logout      -test OK
            createtask  -test NOK -> fix non_existent_executor -> must assign to None
                                    must work on serializer def validate
                                    createtask.py does not work in case executor id does not exist -> should set to None
                                    test does not pass
